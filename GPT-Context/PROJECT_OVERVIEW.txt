🔹 Project Identity

MyNorth is an AI-powered structured planning web app.

V1 is designed as:

A deterministic AI-assisted roadmap execution engine.

It is NOT:

A dynamic adaptive life coach

A habit optimizer

A time enforcement engine

A behavioral AI

V1 prioritizes:

Stability

Debuggability

Deterministic state transitions

Simplicity

🔹 Core Flow

User signs up (Google login via Firebase Auth).

If new user → redirected to intro.

Intro collects user profile data and stores in Firestore.

User goes to dashboard.

User creates a plan.

AI generates full ordered roadmap immediately.

Tasks must be completed sequentially.

Progress is derived from completed tasks.

Calendar is visualization only.

🔹 Plan Structure (V1)

Plan fields:

goal

durationMonths (AI generation guidance only)

level

status: "active" | "completed"

createdAt

completedAt

Duration does NOT enforce pacing.
It only influences how many tasks AI generates.

Plan ends when all tasks are completed.

🔹 Task System (Core of V1)

Each plan contains:

/users/{uid}/plans/{planId}/tasks/{taskId}

Each task:

orderIndex (sequential integer)

title

description (optional)

status: "pending" | "completed" | "deleted"

createdAt

completedAt

Rules:

Tasks must be completed in order.

Only the first pending task is active.

No skipping.

No partial completion.

Equal weight.

Soft delete only (status = deleted).

Deleting reduces total active task count.

Progress recalculates automatically.

🔹 Progress Calculation (Derived Only)

Progress is NEVER stored as manual percentage.

progress = completedTasks / totalActiveTasks


Where:

completedTasks = tasks with status == completed

totalActiveTasks = tasks with status != deleted

If completedTasks == totalActiveTasks:

plan.status = completed

plan.completedAt = timestamp

Plan may end earlier than durationMonths.

No auto duration adjustment.

🔹 Task Completion Flow

User chats.

AI checks only the current active task.

If confident:
AI proposes completion.

User confirms.

System:

Marks task completed

Sets completedAt

Logs action

Recalculates progress

Unlocks next task

Execution is immediate.
No batching.
No scheduler.

🔹 AI Role (Morgan)

Morgan is responsible for:

Generating full roadmap during plan creation.

Detecting completion of current task from chat.

Asking clarification if uncertain.

Proposing structured actions.

Requiring confirmation before state mutation.

Morgan is NOT allowed to:

Modify Firestore directly.

Change duration.

Regenerate tasks.

Skip tasks.

Adjust difficulty.

Penalize inactivity.

Auto-update progress without confirmation.

AI proposes.
System executes.

🔹 Calendar Tab

Calendar is visual only.

It:

Displays completedAt timestamps.

Shows pacing.

Shows inactivity visually.

Does not enforce deadlines.

Does not trigger penalties.

If user disappears:
System does nothing.

🔹 Chat System

Each plan has separate chat context:

/users/{uid}/plans/{planId}/chats/{chatId}

Chat stores:

content

role

createdAt

When chatting, AI receives:

User profile

Plan data

Full task list

Chat history

Chat is used for:

Progress detection

Clarification

Motivation

Confirmation flow

🔹 Action Log (Optional but Recommended)

For traceability:

/users/{uid}/plans/{planId}/actions/{actionId}

Each action:

type

payload

createdAt

triggeredByChatId

Used for:

Debugging

Future undo system

Audit trail

🔹 Authentication Logic

Firebase Authentication (Google only).

On login:

If /users/{uid} exists → go to dashboard

Else → go to intro

Intro saves user profile fields:

age, burnoutFrequency, busiestDay, country,
exerciseRegularly, freeHoursDaily, gender,
industry, mostFreeDays, name, productivityTime,
profession, scheduleType, sleepTime, wakeUpTime,
workHoursPerDay, createdAt, updatedAt

🔹 Explicit Non-Goals for V1

No dynamic difficulty adjustment

No adaptive pacing

No time enforcement

No AI autonomy

No regeneration of roadmap

No partial completion

No task weighting

No inactivity penalty

No automatic duration modification

V1 is strict and sequential by design.

🔹 System Identity Summary

MyNorth V1 is:

A deterministic AI-assisted roadmap execution engine
with sequential task progression and derived progress.

It is intentionally strict to maximize stability,
clarity, and debuggability.
