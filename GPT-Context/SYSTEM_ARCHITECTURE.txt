Core Flow:

1. User logs in via Google (Firebase Auth).
2. If /users/{uid} exists → dashboard.
   Else → intro.
3. Intro collects user profile and stores in Firestore.
4. User creates plan.
5. AI generates full ordered task roadmap immediately.
6. Tasks must be completed sequentially.
7. Progress derived from task completion.
8. Calendar visual only.

Plan Model:
/users/{uid}/plans/{planId}

Fields:
- goal
- durationMonths (generation guidance only)
- level
- status: active | completed
- createdAt
- completedAt

Task Model:
/users/{uid}/plans/{planId}/tasks/{taskId}

Fields:
- orderIndex
- title
- description
- status: pending | completed | deleted
- createdAt
- completedAt

Rules:
- Only first pending task is active.
- No skipping.
- No partial completion.
- Equal weight.
- Soft delete only.

Progress Formula:
progress = completedTasks / totalActiveTasks

Plan completes when:
completedTasks == totalActiveTasks
